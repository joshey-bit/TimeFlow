[Read our data-backed market survey and project report](reports/Time_AccountingService_%20Market_Research.pdf)

## Project Overview
TimeExchange is an innovative service that transforms how individuals understand and value their time. By combining autonomous time-logging with a "time as currency" incentive model, TimeExchange empowers users to gain insights into their daily activities while earning tangible rewards for their time and data contributions.

Our vision is to make time a visible, valuable asset, fostering productivity, well-being, and a new economy powered by user-consented data.

## The Problem
- **Time is our most precious, yet unmanaged, resource.**
- **Lack of time awareness:** Hard to track time spent across work, leisure, and personal tasks; existing tools require tedious manual input.
- **Digital distractions:** Screen time and app usage consume significant portions of our day, often unconsciously.
- **Personal data value:** Users generate vast data but rarely benefit directly from its use by third parties.
- **Few incentives for well-being:** Most digital well-being tools offer insights but little direct motivation for sustained positive change.

---

## Solution: TimeExchange's Core Value Proposition
- **Effortless Autonomous Time-Logging:** Advanced device APIs, sensor fusion, and ML automatically log and categorize activities (Productive, Rest, Chores) with minimal user input (≤3 taps/day).
- **"Time-Coins" as Digital Currency:** Earn time-coins for every minute logged and data shared, turning time into a tangible, redeemable asset.
- **Integrated Rewards Marketplace:** Redeem time-coins for digital coupons, wellness incentives, and more via partner integrations.
- **Personalized Insights & Journaling:** Intuitive dashboard for clear, visual understanding of time allocation.
- **Ethical Data Monetization (B2B):** GDPR/PDPA-compliant, anonymized data licensing to researchers and partners, with user benefit via time-coins.

---

## How It Works (High-Level)
- **Mobile & Wearable Apps:** Collect sensor data, app usage, and screen events in the background.
- **AI-Powered Classification:** ML models classify activities into categories.
- **Time-Coin Ledger:** Securely tracks earned time-coins.
- **Rewards Engine:** Integrates with third-party APIs for coupon redemption and benefits.
- **User Dashboard:** Real-time insights into time usage, coin balance, and rewards.

## Technical Vision (MVP Focus)
- **Frontend:** React Native (iOS/Android), with native modules for deep OS integration
- **Wearable Companion:** WatchOS/WearOS extensions for heart-rate/motion data (if essential)
- **Backend & Data Platform:**
  - Real-time ingestion: Kafka/AWS Kinesis
  - Data processing & ML: Python microservices, TensorFlow
  - Storage: TimescaleDB/PostgreSQL for logs, user profiles, rewards
  - Rewards engine: Relational DB, RESTful APIs for partner integration
  - Analytics: React frontend for insights

---

## Operational MVP with AI-Assisted Development
- **AI-Assisted Coding:** GitHub Copilot for code generation, debugging, and refactoring
- **Backend Prototyping:** Exploring Firebase Studio's AI agents for rapid backend setup
- **No-Code/Low-Code for UI Prototypes:** FlutterFlow for rapid prototyping/admin dashboards (optional)

---

## Phases of Development (MVP First)
- **Phase 0: Proof-of-Concept:** Minimal mobile app logging screen on/off and step count; simple web dashboard for "time-in-use vs. rest."
- **Phase 1: Core MVP:** Manual tagging + AI-based auto-classification; time-coins redeemable for badges/coupons; closed beta (20-50 users).
- **Phase 2: Data Partnerships & Incentives:** Integrate with coupon/fitness partners; pilot B2B anonymized data sharing.
- **Phase 3: Scale & Compliance:** Multi-tenant architecture, privacy certifications, public launch.

---

## Monetization Strategy
- **Freemium Model:** Basic logging/insights free; premium for advanced analytics, exclusive coupons, higher time-coin rates.
- **B2B Sales:** Subscription for aggregated, anonymized dashboards for organizations.
- **Data Licensing:** Anonymized datasets for researchers/partners with strict privacy controls.
- **Incentive Platform Fees:** Commission on coupon redemptions, shared with partners.
